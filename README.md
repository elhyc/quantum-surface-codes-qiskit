# Kitaev surface codes 

(...and other lattice based codes with MWPM-type decoders)



This repository contains a Qiskit implementation of Kitaev surface codes, a topological quantum CSS code family based on planar lattices. It shares much in common with the toric code, but the surface code is more general, flexible and its planar arrangement is easier to implement in practise. A Qiskit implementation of the toric code can be found 
[here]( https://github.com/elhyc/Kitaev-Toric-Code ).
